Linear algebra functions in Processing

Notes: All functions are done starting with index 1 due to standard mathematical notation. 
Do not directly edit a Matrix object with foo.matrix[row-1][column-1], use foo.setIndexM[row][column] instead.
Do not directly edit a Vector object with foo.vector[index-1], use foo.setIndexV[index] instead.

All trig and angle calulations are done and returned in RADIANS, not degrees.
